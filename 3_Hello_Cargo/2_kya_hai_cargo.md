# Kya hai cargo

Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. 
Most Rustaceans(people that are sexually attracted to rust) use this tool to manage their 
Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, 
such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, 
and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs dependencies.)
